# Power-BI-project
In this project, the main goal was to extract meaningful insights from a sales dataset using a combination of SQL for data extraction and manipulation and Power BI for data visualization and dashboard creation. The dataset included various tables that provided details about customers, sales transactions, products, and Markets. By leveraging SQL queries, the data was prepared and cleaned to ensure accurate analysis. This prepared data was then imported into Power BI to create a dynamic and interactive sales dashboard.
